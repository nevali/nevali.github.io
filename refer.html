				<h1>Kickbacks</h1>
				<p>
					These are products or services I use, with links that give
					me (and generally you) some reward if you sign up using
					them. I wouldn't use them if they were rubbish, but that
					rests solely on my opinion, and not everything's for
					everyone. Unless noted, I don't have any relationship with 
					any of these companies besides being an ordinary customer.

					<h1>Monzo Bank</h1>
					<dl>
						<dt>What is it?</dt>
						<dd>
							The most well-known of the next-gen banks. I've not had
							a bad experience with them, and their transparency is
							refreshing. Full disclosure: they employ some of my
							friends. Free sign-up, no monthly fees, but they will
							perform a standard credit check. Everything's done on
							your phone (including live chat with customer services
							if you need it). Works well overseas if you don't have
							a bank account in the local currency (but also see
							<a href="#transferwise">TransferWise</a>, below, who—I
							believe—do Monzo's currency conversions behind the scenes).
						</dd>
						<dt>What do I need to do?</dt>
						<dd>Use <a href="https://join.monzo.com/r/220zrt1">this link</a> to sign up</dd>
						<dt>What do I get?</dt>
						<dd>£5 when you use the card</dd>
						<dt>What's your kickback?</dt>
						<dd>
							Actually, I'm not sure—it's a little unclear; it's
							either £5 as well, or nothing. I don't mind either
							way.
						</dd>

					<h1>TransferWise Borderless Account</h1>
					<dl>
						<dt>What is it?</dt>
						<dd>
							It's <em>not a multi-currency bank account</em> per
							se, but it does an excellent impression of one, and
							is really useful if you travel. You get an account
							number so that you can transfer money to for each of
							the currencies that you choose to activate (GBP, EUR, USD,
							CAN, AUS, and NZD), and a MasterCard Debit card that you
							can use in ATMs and shops in any country you visit. If
							you don't have funds in the currency you're spending in,
							they'll do a conversion on the fly from one of your
							other balances, otherwise it'll just debit as you'd
							expect, and you can convert in advance whenever you want.
							Good exchange rates (Monzo use them for their conversions
							too).
						</dd>
						<dd>
							There are small fees for bank transfers <em>out</em>
							(but not transfers in), and for conversions, but not
							for debits in a currency you have enough of a balance
							in. Free sign-up. I've used this a <em>lot</em> (both in
							the UK and in Germany, with fairly regular conversions to
							Euros from Sterling) with virtually no issues besides
							an occasional processing delay with some UK retailers
							(Tesco at one point left two additional pending "shadow
							transactions" on there along with the real contactless
							transaction, and it didn't resolve itself for a few days,
							but that only happened once and was just a minor annoyance).
						</dd>
						<dt>What do I need to do?</dt>
						<dd>Sign up using <a href="https://transferwise.com/i/mosesm30">this link</a>. You can find out more about it on <a href="https://transferwise.com/gb/borderless/">the main Borderless account page</a> (but use the first link after you've read about it and want to sign up!)</dd>
						<dt>What do I get?</dt>
						<dd>No fees on your first transfer of up to £500. Not the most exciting reward, I realise, but it's a pretty excellent service to begin with.</dd> 
						<dt>What's your kickback?</dt>
						<dd>£50 of free money if three people sign up.</dd>

					<h1>Chipolo</h1>
					<dl>
						<dt>What is it?</dt>
						<dd>
							A low-power Bluetooth 'thing-finder' that syncs with
							your phone. This one's not a <em>service</em>, they're
							just a thing you buy and use with their app.
						</dd>
						<dt>Right, but what is it?</dt>
						<dd>
							It's a little keyfob or card-shaped device, which
							has a speaker and a button. Push the button and
							the app on your phone will make noise (like a
							short-range “Find my phone”). You can also push
							a button in the app and it'll make the Chipolto
							make a noise (i.e., "find my keys"). Optionally
							it'll use your phone's GPS to remember whereabouts
							it was before it last went out of range. You can
							tether multiple Chipolos to one app, if you're
							prone to losing several different things (I am).
						</dd>
						<dt>What do I need to do?</dt>
						<dd>
							Order one using <a href="http://ssqt.co/mefuhKU">this link</a>.
						</dd>
						<dt>What do I get?</dt>
						<dd>
							A 20% discount.
						</dd>
						<dt>What's your kickback?</dt>
						<dd>
							A free Chipolo if three people use that link to buy one.

					<h1>The Bearded Colonel</h1>
					<dl>
						<dt>What is it?</dt>
						<dd>Subscription razors. They send you blades (frequency of
							your choosing) in the post.
						</dd>
						<dt>What do I need to do?</dt>
						<dd>
							Sign up on the <a href="https://beardedcolonel.co.uk">Bearded Colonel website</a>
							and use the code “REFN5ZNM5DZPV” on the last part of
							the checkout (look for the part that says “Have a
							coupon? Click here to enter your code”).
						</dd>
						<dt>What do I get?</dt>
						<dd>
							£5 off the first month.
						</dd>
						<dt>What's your kickback?</dt>
						<dd>
							£5 off my next delivery.
